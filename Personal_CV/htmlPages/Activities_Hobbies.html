        <P>My hobby changes over time as I grow up but there have unchanged which are reading
        engineering books while I understand Alan Walker musics. As you can understand, I do this for 
        engineering course which I'm already familia with. <br>
        I also prefer to make freehand drawings of different pictures; mostly eiher human pictures or
        environmental pictures. </P>
